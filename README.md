A simple visualizer of a bunch of maze generating algorithms I did for Wallpaper Engine.

One great resource for maze generation algorithms is [Buckblog](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap). He outlines some really interesting maze generation algorithms with great clarity, if you want to implement some of your own algorithms, I'd recommend his blog.

## Algorithms
